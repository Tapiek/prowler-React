              With the nuanced history leading up to the 26th century,
              characterized by escalating tensions along the Federation&apos;s
              border, the ceaseless drive to explore uncharted regions, and
              Starfleet&apos;s drive to provide defense at all costs, Starfleet
              Command recognized an imperative need for a groundbreaking class
              of starship -- one capable of seamlessly blending
              intelligence-gathering capabilities, deep space exploration, and
              formidable prowess in combat. Thus, Project Prowler was initiated
              in 2514 by Vice Admiral Celeste Draven.

              Vice Admiral Draven, a remarkable officer with an even remarkable
              track record spanning decades in engineering, exploration, and
              defense, foresaw the necessity of creating a versatile starship
              capable of operating in the fringes of known and unknown space.
              Her firsthand experiences in navigating the complexities of the
              galaxy fueled a resolute determination to develop a vessel that
              could not only gather critical intelligence information but also
              traverse unexplored space with regions that have long eluded
              conventional exploration.

              In close collaboration with the Starfleet Corps of Engineers, Vice
              Admiral Draven curated a diverse team of brilliant minds
              encompassing fields from science and engineering to tactical
              strategy and combat statistics. The Prowler-class was born not
              merely as a starship but as a paradigm shift in the philosophy of
              Starfleet toward defense and deep space exploration.

              It drew inspiration from the innovative strides made during the
              Iconian War, with the subsequent study of advanced
              exo-technologies encountered during such a tumultuous era
              providing meaningful insights. Admiral Draven&apos;s insistence on
              integrating cutting-edge offensive capabilities into the
              ship&apos;s design reflected an approach to a galaxy that was
              constantly changing and was constantly in a state of war. She
              would ensure that the Prowler-class would be equipped to defend
              not only itself but also the strategic interests of both Starfleet
              and the Federation.

              Simultaneously, Dr. Elias Kovari, a prodigy in subspace physics,
              spearheaded the development of Hyperphase Beam technology. Drawing
              inspiration from assimilation-resistant technologies encountered
              during the Borg campaigns, and those against the Vaadwar,
              Kovari&apos;s team harnessed subspace manipulation principles that
              could craft a directed energy weapon with unparalleled precision
              and unparalleled penetration. This newfound weapon became
              Starfleet&apos;s symbol of adaptability.

              At the same time as all of this was happening, Lieutenant
              Commander Sera Dax was working on a new transwarp device. Her
              invention, titled the Quantum Harmonic Subspace Propulsion System
              (QHSPS), or the Hyperphase Transwarp Drive, or simply the
              Hyperphase Drive, stands as a testament to her vision and her
              substantial contributions to Starfleet&apos;s technology. The
              Hyperphase Drive seamlessly integrates with Dr. Kovari&apos;s
              Hyperphase Beam. It creates a synergy that elevates the
              Prowler-class to unprecedented levels of capability.

              In 2522, after five years of strenuous and arduous research,
              development, and testing, the USS Prowler NX-2126 was commissioned
              as the flagship of the Prowler-class. Commanded by a seasoned and
              resourceful Captain J. Prescott, with Commander Thrax Styke by his
              side, the USS Prowler embarked on its maiden voyage into the
              uncharted territories of the Beta Quadrant.

              The recruitment for the drive of the Prowler became a pivotal
              chapter in its history. It needed to assemble a crew befitting of
              the cutting-edge technology and the newfound vessel poised for its
              maiden voyage. Starfleet sought candidates with a unique skillset,
              spanning from intelligence operations, stellar cartography,
              brilliant scientists, and combat proficiency, Admiral Draven
              echoed the calls for applicants across the entirety of the
              Federation.

              Draven actively scoured for officers possessing unique and
              specialized skillsets in subspace physics, quantum harmonics,
              transwarp technology, and individuals with firsthand experience in
              assimilation-resistant technologies. Intelligence and tactical
              expertise were paramount in the recruitment process, as the
              Prowler-class demanded a crew adept at both the nuances of
              intelligence operations, as well as the challenges brought forth
              by combat. Draven collaborated closely with Starfleet Intelligence
              as recruitment teams sought officers with a proven track record.
              The vessels&apos; role in probing the unknown necessitated a crew
              capable of navigating the unknown, anomalies, and potential
              threats.

              The recruitment effort for the Prowler wasn&apos;t merely about
              qualifications; it was an invitation to those who had a spirit of
              pioneering. Draven actively searched for officers yearning for the
              thrill of charting new frontiers, officers who had a passion for
              discovery, and a commitment to upholding the Federation&apos;s
              principles. As Command opened its doors for the next generation of
              explorers, scientists, defenders, and brilliant minds, the call to
              join the crew of the USS Prowler became an opportunity to be at
              the forefront of the most ambitious mission. The Prowler would
              leave a mark on Federation history.
